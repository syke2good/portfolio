# Portfolio
*This homework assignment was about how a market yourself by creating a Portfolio for yourself so you are more likely to get hired. A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. This time I didn't have the starter code so i had to start from scratch. I had to use all of the HTML and CSS skills that i learned in class to come up with my own peronal portfolio*.

# Completed Acceptance Criteria:

I provided some sample of my previous work.
I applied semantic HTML elements.
I have presented with the my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, my work, and how to contact me.
I included the UI to scroll to the corresponding section.
I resized the page to view the site on various screens and devices.
I included a well illustrated element attributes.
Bonus changes:

I made sure all links are functioning correctly.
I used my CSS skills to style and make it efficient and accurate.
I organized CSS to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
I also included comments on each element i wrote in html and CSS.
What did i do to complete this assingment?:

*With these points in mind, in this homework I set myself up for future success by applying the core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. I got to practice my new skills while creating something that I will use during my job search. Itâ€™s a win-win that I'll likely be grateful for in the future!*

# The Result

*With the help of everyone and my tutor, using application of concepts, and making specific changes to the files, I was able to ensure an accesible, efficient, and easy way to build my portfolio. I had help from plenty of websites such as W3 schools, MDN and much more.*
